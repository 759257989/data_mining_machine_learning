# ðŸ§  Data Mining & Machine Learning

This repository contains my coursework and projects for the Data Mining & Machine Learning class. It covers practical applications of data understanding, data manipulation, supervised and unsupervised learning, and the deployment of machine learningâ€“based Python services.

# ðŸ“Œ Overview

This course focuses on:

Data Understanding & Preparation â€” cleaning, transforming, and exploring datasets.

Supervised & Unsupervised Learning â€” training, tuning, and evaluating predictive models.

Model Deployment â€” packaging Python ML services into interactive applications.

Evaluation Techniques â€” metrics and validation methods to assess model performance.

Advanced Topics â€” select modern techniques in supervised learning.

Hands-on Project â€” applying learned concepts to solve a real-world data problem.
